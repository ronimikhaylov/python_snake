Game window is set to 300x300 <br />
This is code for the classic snake game where the player guides a moving line which ultimately, becomes an obstacle for itself.<br />
It grows as it collides with a food object. <br />
If it goes outside the game window, game over will be displayed.
If it collides with itself, game over will also be displayed.
